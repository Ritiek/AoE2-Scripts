# AoE2-Scripts

Collection of Age of Empires 2 scripts and macros.

## How to use them?

- You can download any of the pre-compiled binaries directly from this repository and use them.

- If you're not okay with running these pre-compiled binaries for security reasons (which is good), you can always take a look at the source code and compile them yourself.

## What do they do?

### [convert_monk.au3](convert_monk.au3)

Automatically deselect a monk from a group of monks for easy multi conversions.

Check out this [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-MIimH9Kz8&t=0m24s) for more details.

- Download the binary or compile it yourself.
- Run `convert_monk.exe` and feed the key you would like to use as a macro.
- Run AoE2 and select some units, place your mouse pointer on the first unit and press `F10` key, so the script knows where to click at when deselecting a monk.

- You're done.
- Edit the created `convert_monk.ini` to change your macro key or coordinates.
